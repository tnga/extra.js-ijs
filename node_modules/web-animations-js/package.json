  "readme": "\nQuick Start\n-----------\n\nTo provide native Chrome Web Animation features (`Element.animate` and Playback\nControl) in other browsers, use `web-animations.min.js`. To explore all of the\nproposed Web Animations API, use `web-animations-next.min.js`.\n\nWhat is Web Animations?\n-----------------------\n\nWeb Animations is a new JavaScript API for driving animated content on the web.\nBy unifying the animation features of SVG and CSS, Web Animations unlocks\nfeatures previously only usable declaratively, and exposes powerful,\nhigh-performance animation capabilities to developers.\n\nFor more details see the\n[W3C specification](http://w3c.github.io/web-animations/).\n\nWhat is the polyfill?\n---------------------\n\nThe polyfill is a JavaScript implementation of the Web Animations API. It works\non modern versions of all major browsers. For more details about browser\nsupport see <https://www.polymer-project.org/resources/compatibility.html>.\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\nHere's a simple example of an animation that scales and changes the opacity of\na `<div>` over 0.5 seconds. The animation alternates producing a pulsing\neffect.\n\n    <script src=\"web-animations.min.js\"></script>\n    <div class=\"pulse\" style=\"width:150px;\">Hello world!</div>\n    <script>\n        var elem = document.querySelector('.pulse');\n        var animation = elem.animate([\n            {opacity: 0.5, transform: \"scale(0.5)\"},\n            {opacity: 1.0, transform: \"scale(1)\"}\n        ], {\n            direction: 'alternate',\n            duration: 500,\n            iterations: Infinity\n        });\n    </script>\n\nWeb Animations supports off-main-thread animations, and also allows procedural\ngeneration of animations and fine-grained control of animation playback. See\n<http://web-animations.github.io> for ideas and inspiration!\n\nNative Fallback\n---------------\n\nWhen the polyfill runs on a browser that implements `Element.animate` and\n`Animation` Playback Control it will detect and use the underlying native\nfeatures.\n\nDifferent Build Targets\n-----------------------\n\n### web-animations.min.js\n\nTracks the Web Animations features that are supported natively in browsers.\nToday that means Element.animate and Playback Control in Chrome. If you’re not\nsure what features you will need, start with this.\n\n### web-animations-next.min.js\n\nContains all of web-animations.min.js plus features that are still undergoing\ndiscussion or have yet to be implemented natively.\n\n### web-animations-next-lite.min.js\n\nA cut down version of web-animations-next, it removes several lesser used\nproperty handlers and some of the larger and less used features such as matrix\ninterpolation/decomposition.\n\n### Build Target Comparison\n\n|                        | web-animations | web-animations-next | web-animations-next-lite |\n|------------------------|:--------------:|:-------------------:|:------------------------:|\n|Size (gzipped)          | 12.5kb         | 14kb                | 10.5kb                   |\n|Element.animate         | ✔             | ✔                  | ✔                       |\n|Timing input (easings, duration, fillMode, etc.) for animation effects| ✔ | ✔ | ✔             | \n|Playback control        | ✔             | ✔                  | ✔                       |\n|Support for animating lengths, transforms and opacity| ✔ | ✔ | ✔                       |\n|Support for animating other CSS properties| ✔ | ✔            | 🚫                       |\n|Matrix fallback for transform animations | ✔ | ✔             | 🚫                       |\n|KeyframeEffect constructor   | 🚫             | ✔                  | ✔                       |\n|Simple GroupEffects & SequenceEffects           | 🚫             | ✔                  | ✔                       |\n|Custom Effects          | 🚫             | ✔                  | ✔                       |\n|Timing input (easings, duration, fillMode, etc.) for groups</div>| 🚫 | 🚫\\* | 🚫         |\n|Additive animation      | 🚫\\*           | 🚫\\*                | 🚫                       |\n|Motion path             | 🚫\\*           | 🚫\\*                | 🚫                       |\n|Modifiable keyframe effect timing| 🚫          | 🚫\\*                | 🚫\\*                     |\n|Modifiable group timing | 🚫             | 🚫\\*                | 🚫\\*                     |\n|Usable inline style\\*\\* | ✔             | ✔                  | 🚫                       |\n\n\\* support is planned for these features.\n\\*\\* see inline style caveat below.\n\nCaveats\n-------\n\nSome things won’t ever be faithful to the native implementation due to browser\nand CSS API limitations. These include:\n\n### Inline Style\n\nInline style modification is the mechanism used by the polyfill to animate\nproperties. Both web-animations and web-animations-next incorporate a module\nthat emulates a vanilla inline style object, so that style modification from\nJavaScript can still work in the presence of animations. However, to keep the\nsize of web-animations-next-lite as small as possible, the style emulation\nmodule is not included. When using this version of the polyfill, JavaScript\ninline style modification will be overwritten by animations.\nDue to browser constraints inline style modification is not supported on iOS 7\nor Safari 6 (or earlier versions).\n\n### Prefix handling\n\nThe polyfill will automatically detect the correctly prefixed name to use when\nwriting animated properties back to the platform. Where possible, the polyfill\nwill only accept unprefixed versions of experimental features. For example:\n\n    var effect = new KeyframeEffect(elem, {\"transform\": \"translate(100px, 100px)\"}, 2000);\n\nwill work in all browsers that implement a conforming version of transform, but\n\n    var effect = new KeyframeEffect(elem, {\"-webkit-transform\": \"translate(100px, 100px)\"}, 2000);\n\nwill not work anywhere.\n\nAPI and Specification Feedback\n------------------------------\n\nFile an issue on GitHub: <https://github.com/w3c/web-animations/issues/new>.\nAlternatively, send an email to <public-fx@w3.org> with subject line\n“[web-animations] … message topic …”\n([archives](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-fx/)).\n\nPolyfill Issues\n---------------\n\nReport any issues with this implementation on GitHub:\n<https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-next/issues/new>.\n\nBreaking changes\n----------------\n\nWhen we make a potentially breaking change to the polyfill's API\nsurface (like a rename) we will, where possible, continue supporting the\nold version, deprecated, for three months, and ensure that there are\nconsole warnings to indicate that a change is pending. After three\nmonths, the old version of the API surface (e.g. the old version of a\nfunction name) will be removed. *If you see deprecation warnings you\ncan't avoid it by not updating*.\n\nWe also announce anything that isn't a bug fix on\n[web-animations-changes@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/web-animations-changes).\n",
