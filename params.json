{"name":"iJS","tagline":"Mini library for javaScript language with functionalities that facilitate  project’s development and can be associated with all existing JS libraries. ","body":"iJS: inside JavaScript\r\n======================\r\n> Simple mini library which provide some functionalities that facilitate JavaScript development of the associated projects.\r\n\r\nIt’s firstly build with [UMI web’s projects](http://umiproject.sf.net) and for pure JavaScript development.\r\nHowever it can be use for any JavaScript projects.\r\n\r\nThe goal is not to build another big library like Jquery, Mootools, AngularJS, ..., but to complete them.\r\nThe script is written in pure JavaScript, so it’s independent and can be easily associated to any previous libraries. \r\n\r\n##What’s there?\r\n\r\n####Internationalization\r\nActually the main feature of the library is the Javascript implementation of GNU Gettext API.   \r\nThis implementation of GNU Gettext, providing internationalization support for JavaScript. \r\nIt differs from existing JavaScript implementations in that it will support all current Gettext features \r\n(ex. plural and context support), and will also support loading language catalogs from .mo, .po, \r\nor preprocessed json files (*converter included*).\r\n\r\nIn this case the \"i\" in **iJS** can be considered as **i**nternalization.\r\n\r\n####Animation\r\nNot yet powerfull, but will grow up soon. Documentation is a friends to see what are provided. \r\n\r\n####Some simple functionnalities\r\nSee the documentation for more informations about all the library’s features.\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\n\r\nThere are two possible ways:\r\n\r\n1. Directly include it in your project via the official link where you will sure to have the latest version.\r\n2. [Download the code](https://github.com/tnga/extra.js-ijs/archive/master.zip) and follow instructions.\r\n  - The minify code is sufficient to include it to your project.\r\n  - Read the documentation for more information.\r\n\r\n##The LGPL version 3\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) (April->August)-2015 [Tindo Ngoufo Arsel](mailto:devtnga@gmail.com)\r\n\r\nSee [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/tnga/extra.js-ijs/blob/master/LICENSE.md) for more details.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
